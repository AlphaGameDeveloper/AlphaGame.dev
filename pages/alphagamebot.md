# AlphaGameBot
AlphaGameBot is yet another Discord bot.  It was made in Discord.py and designed to be a free bot for people to have fun with.  I am not a fan of people making mostly paid Discord bots, and advertising them to be "free" while having most commands locked behind a paywall.

## Features
* Local 49ers fan :)
* XKCD Integrations with **/xkcd**
* Need memes?  Get some with **/meme**.  Uses r/memes and other APIs.
* Commands for pinging Minecraft servers (Java & Bedrock) (**/minecraft java** and **/minecraft bedrock**)
* Safe--I value privacy, so we don't have accounts to deal with :)
    * *100% not because i was lazy :)*
* **A creator who listens!  I love a good challenge, so if you have any ideas for commands, I would be excited to add it!**
    * Made *for the people*, ***by the people***.

## Give AlphaGameBot a shot!

## If you are a server admin...
Hi, fellow server admin!  I wanted to say that if you are getting spammed by requests from AlphaGameBot (User agent is usually: `python-requests/2.31.0; curl/8.4.0; AlphaGameBot/1; https://alphagame.dev/ +damien@alphagame.dev`), I'm sorry for this bug.  I try to keep my bot from irresponsibly spamming servers, but sometimes I make mistakes.  If you have a problem with the bot, please do not block it; rather, please send me an email at [damien@alphagame.dev](mailto:damien@alphagame.dev), so I can fix this in AlphaGameBot.  Thanks!

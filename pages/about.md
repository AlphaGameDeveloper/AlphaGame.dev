# About Me

Hi!  My name is Damien, but on the World Wide Web, I usually go by AlphaGameDeveloper.  I run my website, [alphagame.dev](https://alphagame.dev/), and write blog posts in my free time on my [blog](/blog), so you can go check that out!  I have passion for programming, game development, web design, pretty much anything computer-related!  I also do Taekwondo, and am hopefully going to get my black belt in the December of 2024.

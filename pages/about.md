# About Me

Hi!  My name is Damien, but on the World Wide Web, I usually go by AlphaGameDeveloper.  I run my website, [alphagame.dev](https://alphagame.dev/), and write blog posts in my free time on my [blog](/blog), so you can go check that out!  I have passion for programming, game development, web design, pretty much anything computer-related!  In Taekwondo, I am a recommended-black belt.

I am a member of FRC team 2551, [Penguin Empire Robotics](https://www.penguinempirerobotics.org/) ([@PenguinEmpire](https://github.com/PenguinEmpire) on GitHub).  I am part of the programming group.

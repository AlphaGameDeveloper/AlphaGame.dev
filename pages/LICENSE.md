# Licensing
Hey-

Listen, I know that throwing licenses at you sounds like I am trying to take away your rights-- like I'm a stubborn *"IM GONNA SUE YOUR ASS RIGHT NOW!"* guy.  I want to say that, by licensing this content, I am <u>protecting</u> your rights to distribute my works, and build off of it.  I want to say that I am open-source by nature, and I don't want to take anyone's rights.  That goes against almost everything I believe in, being a strong believer in the open-source philosophy--These license terms are meant to keep your freedoms to distribute, build off of, and do what you want with my works. *(within reason)*

Most open-source software licenses *(yes, this website technically is not software<sup>[1]</sup>)* are meant to take away your rights, but this site is licensed to protect said rights.  I want to tell you the terms of my software, and what you can and can not do with it.  All of my software is open-source, so it should not be so bad.  Setting a license on your works is important--[This is what GitHub says](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) on choosealicense.com.

## This website

This website is licensed under the terms of the *Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International* License.  The full terms are [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-4.0/), but here is the english, rather than legalese, because *who wants to read THAT*?

Almost all of my software *(with a few exceptions)* is licensed under the *GNU General Purpose Licence Version 3*, or **GNU GPL v3**.  Again, the terms are [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).  In English, because *who wants to read THAT legalese*?

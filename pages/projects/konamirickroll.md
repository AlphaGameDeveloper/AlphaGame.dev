# KonamiRickroll

## What is it?
KonamiRickroll is a small JavaScript file that will allow you to easily add a secret rickroll to your website!
The script is very plug-and-play, especially for simple websites.  The script will replace the website with a
rickroll when the *"Konami Code"* is entered.

## The Konami Code
The Konami Code, also called the *Contra Code* or *30 Lives code* is a cheat-code found in many Konami video games on the NES.

The code is as follows: **UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGhT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A**

## Try it for yourself!
KonamiRickroll works on [alphagame.dev](https://alphagame.dev), so you can try it for yourself here.  If you want to embed it in *your*
website, here is a HTML snippet for you!

**Minified version (loads faster)**
```html
<script src="https://alphagame.dev/assets/js/konamirickroll.min.js"></script>
```
**Full version (Human-readable code)**
```html
<script src="https://alphagame.dev/assets/js/konamirickroll.js"></script>
```

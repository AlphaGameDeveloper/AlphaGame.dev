# MBTI Research
I am a hardcore MBTI *(Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)* nerd.  Othen, I do some of my own research on MBTI, and want to publish it for the world to see.

## What is MBTI?

MBTI stands for the *Myers-Briggs Type Indicator*, a system to express everyone's unique personality as one of the 16 types.  MBTI types consist of four letters, with four individual traits.  Because *4<sup>2</sup> = 16*, we get our 16 personalities.  

<!-- Here's a quick rundown about how the system works -->
<!--
Your first letter is either **I** or **E**, and it shows if you are *Introverted* or *Extraverted*.
* **Introverted** Individuals:
    * Prefer to be alone
    * Are quiet
    * Are self-aware
    * Have few, but very close friends
* **Extraverted** Individuals:
    * Like working in groups
    * Are described as energetic
    * Can be impulsive
    * Make friends easily

Your second letter is either **N** or **S**, and it shows if you are *Intuitive* or *Sensing (Observant)*.  
Note: *"Sensing"* and *"Observant"* can be used interchangeably, it's a matter of personal prefeence.
* **Intuitive** Individuals:
    * Enjoy exercising their mind
    * *"Head in the clouds"*
    * Deep inner world
* **Sensing/Observant** Indivuduals

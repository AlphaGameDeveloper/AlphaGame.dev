# AlphaGameBot Privacy Policy
AlphaGameBot is quite privacy-focused.  It does not track much data, and the data it *does* track
is only data that is essential for the bot to function correctly.  Examples of data that the bot
will track are:
* Bot Errors (I will eventually add a feature to opt-out of this)
* User Settings
    * These are not implimented yet, but this is to be able to customize your experience with AlphaGameBot

## Data collected passively
Data is not sold.  Period.  I DO NOT SELL YOUR DATA, NOR DO I TRACK ALL OF YOUR INTERACTIONS.
Anonymous information is put in the bot's Python console.  Examples of output is

```
listener/INFO - /xkcd called
cogwheel/INFO - Web request called to https://xkcd.com/info.0.json
cogwheel/INFO - Web request finished. StatusCode=200 (OK), time=2ms from_cache:yes
listener/INFO - /meme called
cogwheel/INFO - Web request called to https://meme-api.com/gimme
cogwheel/INFO - Web request finished.  StatusCode=200 (OK), time=7ms from_cache:disabled
... etc ...
```

No personally identifiable information is put in the bot's console. This information is only used
for debugging purposes and to help ensure the quality of AlphaGameBot.

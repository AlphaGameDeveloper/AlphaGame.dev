# AlphaGameBot Terms of Service
While AlphaGameBot is free and open-source, there are a few things that I expect from you, the bot user; and that you can expect from me.  This will let you know what your rights are while using AlphaGameBot.

## Please don't do these things...

* Use AlphaGameBot for *any and all* illegal purposes
* Present AlphaGameBot (or forks of it) as your own work... Feel free to say you changed it... That'll be cool, just give me credit, please :)

## Do these awesome things!
* Use AlphaGameBot for any purpose that is allowed under [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
* Modify AlphaGameBot under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 3 (or at your option, any later version)
    * Distribute your changes! (please give me credit, though!)
    * Host your own instances of AlphaGameBot, **just mark it as a 3rd-party instance!**

## Postscript
**These terms were last updated on {{ page.modified }}**

*Note: I reserve the right to update these terms anytime.  New changes are made effective 2 weeks after being initially posted.*

# AlphaGameBot
AlphaGameBot is yet another Discord bot.  It was made in Discord.py and designed to be a free bot for people to have fun with.  I am not a fan of people making mostly paid Discord bots, and advertising them to be "free" while having most commands locked behind a paywall.

**The FAQ can be found [here](/alphagamebot/faq)!**

**The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AlphaGameBot/AlphaGameBot), and the WebUI [here](https://github.com/AlphaGameBot/WebUI)**

## Features
* Local 49ers fan :)
* XKCD Integrations with **/xkcd**
* Need memes?  Get some with **/meme**.  Uses r/memes and other APIs.
* Commands for pinging Minecraft servers (Java & Bedrock) (**/minecraft java** and **/minecraft bedrock**)
* Safe--I value privacy, so we don't have accounts to deal with :)
    * *100% not because I was lazy :)*
* **A creator who listens!  I love a good challenge, so if you have any ideas for commands, I would be excited to add it!**
    * Made *for the people*, ***by the people***.
* Nice, Intuitive WebUI! **/user settings**

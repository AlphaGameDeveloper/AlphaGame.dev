# AlphaGameBot-Nightly

*AlphaGameBot-Nightly* is a seperate Discord bot, using AlphaGameBot's source
code along with any cool features that I've been working on.  *AlphaGameBot-Nightly* is deployed every night at 12:00 midnight (PST) from the `nightly` branch.  Stuff on *AlphaGameBot-Nightly* is still in heavy development, so it could change at any moment without notice. It
does contain new stuff and commands that I have working-ish, but they are either not complete or I am not confident enough to push to the [Production AlphaGameBot](/alphagamebot).

*AlphaGameBot-Nightly* does have a few things that should be addressed:

1. *AlphaGameBot-Nightly* does not count your messages or do leveling.  This is because I don't want not-production-ready code to be writing to the database.  (`-q` on the command-line)
2. Stuff on *AlphaGameBot-Nightly* may be changed or removed in the final feature release, or it might not be released at all.  *AlphaGameBot-Nightly* is just a beta version, where I can show off current progress.

Feel free to send some feedback on the [AlphaGameBot Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ECJS6ssyf4)!
Also, [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AlphaGameBot/AlphaGameBot/issues/new) are open, so please open one if you find some bugs *wink wink nudge nudge ;)*

# AlphaGameBot FAQ

[Return to AlphaGameBot](/alphagamebot/)

## Will AlphaGameBot ever be a paid bot?
No.  AlphaGameBot is hosted in my house on my server, Hubby.  If I ever need to, it will be donation based.

## What did you write AlphaGameBot in?
I wrote it in `discord.py`, or to be more specific, `py-cord` [(learn more)](https://pycord.dev/).  I chose it because it felt like the best choice, because I am familiar with Python, and `discord.py`.  `py-cord` is compatible with `discord.py` code, as a drop-in replacement!

## When did you start working on AlphaGameBot?
I think I started in early December or late November of 2024.  I don't know the exact date, as I only started using it with Git later on (December 22, 2024).  The bot says it was made in 2022, but it was not AlphaGameBot at that point, it was a small app I made called "Chat Chat" (it sucked)

## Are you still working on AlphaGameBot?
Hell yeah!  I am working on AlphaGameBot with all the time I can (which sadly is not much, I'm a high-school student), but YOU can contrbute on its [GitHub page][github]

## Will AlphaGameBot always be open-source?
Yes.  I am a strong supporter of open-source software, and I love to be having such a large application open-sourced.  There are not many open-source public discord bots out there, and it's my job to fix that!

## Can I contribute to AlphaGameBot?
Yes.  Feel free to make a pull request to the AlphaGameBot [GitHub repository][github]!  Please note that all contributions must be:
* Not A.I. Generated--All code must be human-written.  This allows the bot to maintain my high standard of almost no A.I. generated code.
* Useful--The contribution must be useful in one way or another.

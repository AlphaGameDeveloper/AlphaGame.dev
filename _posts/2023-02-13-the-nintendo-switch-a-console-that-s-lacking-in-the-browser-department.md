title: "The Nintendo Switch: A Console That's Lacking in the Browser Department"
---
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ah, the Nintendo Switch, a beloved console that's perfect for gaming on the go, right? Well, not so fast! While the Switch has a lot of great features, there's one major aspect that it's lacking: an internet browser. <!--more-->That's right, you read it correctly, the Nintendo Switch doesn't have a built-in internet browser, which is pretty crazy when you think about it.</p>

<p>In this day and age, where we have access to the world wide web right at our fingertips, it's almost unfathomable that a modern gaming console wouldn't have a browser. It's like trying to cook a meal without a stove, or drive a car without wheels. It just doesn't make any sense!</p>

<p>So, what do you do when you want to check your email, look up a recipe, or just browse the web in general on your Nintendo Switch? You're forced to use exploits via DNS to access Google, which just feels like a big ol' hassle. It's not like we're trying to hack into NASA's mainframe or anything, we just want to use a simple internet browser on our console. Is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>The whole situation is just a bummer, and it's a missed opportunity for Nintendo. Imagine being able to sit back on your couch, controller in hand, and surf the web while you're waiting for your friends to join your online gaming session. That would be awesome, but alas, it's just not possible on the Switch.</p>

<p>So, what's the solution? Well, it's simple really. Nintendo just needs to add an internet browser to the Switch. It wouldn't take much effort, and it would make the console so much more versatile. It's not like we're asking for the moon here, folks. Just give us a browser, Nintendo, and we'll be one step closer to making the Switch the ultimate gaming console.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the lack of an internet browser on the Nintendo Switch is a real bummer. It's a missed opportunity for Nintendo and makes accessing the web a hassle. Let's hope that the big N hears our pleas and adds a browser to the Switch in the near future. Until then, we'll just have to make do with exploits via DNS. Sigh.</p>

<p>If you're wondering, the DNS server I use to get Google is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.switchbru.com/dns/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.switchbru.com/dns/" target="_blank">SwitchBru DNS</a>.  To use it, change your DNS server to: </p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>45.55.142.122</code></pre>

<p>It's worth mentioning that not only does Nintendo not have browser support, but they explicitly <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remove</span> features like YouTube in their controlled browser.</p>

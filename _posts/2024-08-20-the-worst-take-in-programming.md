title: The Worst Take in Programming
---

This is a little post while I am working on the next, but when I saw this, I could not not write about it.

So yes, I have found the worst take imaginable.  

![variables in computer programming are so stupid and i don't get why everyone sucks their dick all the time. why not use their values at center instead of making a lazy shortcut?](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/320773f5-d3ae-487e-8b7e-24439b5a6b1e)

I mean, I should have expected as much from the username *OhioRizz99*, but SERIOUSLY.  Yes, he said he was learning Python
and HTML doesn't have variables, but SERIOUSLY.  COME ON, IF YOU STARTED LEARNING PYTHON, YOU MUST HAVE LEARNED ABOUT VARIABLES
AND HOW USEFUL THEY ARE!!! 

Feel free to post your opinions in the *new!* comments section.  This is something I set up shortly after the previous post, and
think'll make a nice addition to the website.  A post for another day :)

Cheers,
Damien

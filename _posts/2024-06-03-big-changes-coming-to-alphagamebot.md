title: Big Changes Coming to AlphaGameBot
layout: post
---

AlphaGameBot, thus far, has not collected much data, and the only data that it *does* collect, is data that is 100% required to function.  Recently, I have been working on a **/userstats** command, 
which requires AlphaGameBot to track the number of messages sent by a given user.  With the launch of AlphaGameBot **3.1**, this data will be tracked, and a future version will give functionality to
opt-out of this.  This will come along with the WebUI update to AlphaGameBot, in which you can change your privacy settings.  This is currently being worked on, and will *hopefully* be launched this summer,
but, as I learned with previous projects, I suck with deadlines, so I cannot give a guarantee with the launch date.

I would like to reiterate what I already said in the [privacy policy](/alphagamebot/privacy).  **I WILL NOT SELL YOUR DATA.**  Believe me, I know how much it sucks to have people selling your data behind your
back.  *It sucks.*  Another thing that I want to point out is that **YOUR MESSAGES WILL NOT BE SAVED.**  All that happens when you send a message is that a number in my database goes up by one.  That is all that
happens, as far as your data is concerned.  *If you do not believe me, please feel free to check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlphaGameBot/AlphaGameBot).  The production version of AlphaGameBot 
always in sync with the `master` branch on github, so that is the current code.  

Please, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, email me at [damien@alphagame.dev](damien@alphagame.dev).

Cheers!
AlphaGameDeveloper.

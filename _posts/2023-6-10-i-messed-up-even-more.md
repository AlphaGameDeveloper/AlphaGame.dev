Hey all-

I messed up, AGAIN. I ACTUALLY think that this is the last time that this is going to happen. Recently, the site was on a weird /wp-admin/install.php page, where the WordPress software was installed, and the MySQL database was all going well, but the installer was trying to get the software (that is already installed) installed AGAIN.

I don’t have the exact logs, but I have (accidentally) remembered some.

```
Error during WordPress installation:
CREATE TABLE wordpress -- already exists.
(repeat this a lot)
```
But yeah– I have set up a proper automatic backup system to Google Drive. Hopefully I won’t screw it up AGAIN.

Thanks-

Damien B.

## Note
**This post is a work-in-progress.**  Some things may be inaccurate, and other things may change.  Doing your own research is always recommended.

## Introduction
ENTP is a MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality type.  People with the ENTP personality are also called *"The Debater"*, because of their legendary capacity for debate.  In my *(somewhat biased)* opinion, I think that ENTP is my favorite MBTI type because of how interesting it is to read about!  *(ENTJ comes in at a close second)*.  This type will debate with anyone, about anything!

## What is MBTI?
MBTI, or the *Myers-Briggs Type Indicator*, is a set of 16 unique personalities, all with their own acronyms.  For example, ENTP stands for the *Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting* traits.  For those of you who do not know, MBTI types are composed of four letters, each giving a trait.  This is the order:
* **I**ntroverted or **E**xtraverted (I/E) - (description needed)
* I**N**tuitive or **S**ensing (N/S) - How you take in information
* **T**hinking or **F**eeling (T/F) - How you make decisions
* **P**rospecting or **J**udging (P/J) - (description needed)

So that's kind of a rough overview of MBTI.  If you want to learn more, check out [16 Personalities](https://16personalitied.com/)!

## The ENTP

<blockquote>
Quick, ingenious, stimulating, alert, and outspoken. Resourceful in solving new and challenging problems. Adept at generating conceptual possibilities and then analyzing them strategically. Good at reading other people. Bored by routine, will seldom do the same thing the same way, apt to turn to one new interest after another. <cite><a href="https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/the-16-mbti-personality-types/#:~:text=ENTP,interest%20after%20another.">Myers Briggs</a></cite>
</blockquote>

### Outspoken
ENTPs are one of the more outspoken types, as they're not afraid to reject the status quo.  People with the ENTP personality are not afraid to speak up about their opinions.  ENTPs are natural advocates for change and progress when they identify areas for improvement in their community, workplace, or society at large, actively campaigning for their ideas and pushing for reform.

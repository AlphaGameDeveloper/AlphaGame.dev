<p>Hey-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Recently, I have picked up on Penny collecting -- So, you know those machines at almost all <em>(to my knowledge, please prove me wrong in the comments)</em> of the U.S national parks, and other places too.  I have picked up on this because it is cheap <em>(most to my knowledge are 51 cents each, with four penny designs per machine, so it takes me $2 to clear out a machine.)</em>  I have been using an online database of machine locations at <a href="http://209.221.138.252/AreaList.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pennycollector.com</a>,  so yeah.  I felt that that would be a fun  (and slightly off-topic, let's be honest) source of content for this site.</p>

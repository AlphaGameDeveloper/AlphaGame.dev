<p>Hey all-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I messed up, AGAIN.  I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACTUALLY</span> think that this is the last time that this is going to happen.  Recently, the site was on a weird <code>/wp-admin/install.php</code> page, <!--more-->where the WordPress software was installed, and the MySQL database was all going well, but the installer was trying to get the software (that is already installed) installed AGAIN.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't have the exact logs, but I have (accidentally) remembered some.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Error during WordPress installation:
CREATE TABLE wordpress -- already exists.
(repeat this a lot)</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But yeah-- I have set up a proper automatic backup system to Google Drive.  Hopefully I won't screw it up AGAIN.</p>

<p>Thanks-</p>

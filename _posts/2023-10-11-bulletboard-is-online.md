<p>Hey-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just set up a school forum for my high school.  The purpose of this was to see what it would be like if high-schoolers were given a mostly unmoderated, minimal-rules forum for them to trash on.  Now, it's finally online and ready to be tortured to lengths the software (and server) most likely were not meant to be pushed.</p>

<p>I can't wait! <em>(nervous laughter)</em></p><!--more-->

<p>It is now online at <a href="https://bulletboard.alphagame.dev/">https://bulletboard.alphagame.dev/</a></p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

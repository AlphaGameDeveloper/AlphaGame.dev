title: AlphaGameBot 2.4 Changelog!
---
Hey yo!

AlphaGameBot version **2.4** has been released!  Here's what we got:
* **/dnd** command - Roll D&D dice in Discord!
* Remove Python error in production
* **Add Error Reporting** - Now you can report the error by simply pressing a button under the error!  This can help with squashing the bugs!

Cheers,
 * AlphaGameDeveloper

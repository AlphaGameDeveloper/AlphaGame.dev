title: Syncing VSCode Extensions
layout: post
---

If you're like me, you have quite a few extensions running on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).  I also have recently picked up some new macbooks near a dumpster, and turned them into laptops that I use for development when I'm not at home (Forgot to bring my 100-freaking-pound desktop PC and monitor with me :/)

I have a few extensions that I just expect to work.  Stuff like [Wakatime][wakatime], and a few language-specific extensions.  It becomes a pain to manually install, uninstall, and manage all your extensions manually.  After a quick Google search, I found a feature that comes out-of-the-box with VSCode: Settings Sync.  It's amazing because all I really have to do is login with my GitHub account to VSCode, and it pulls my configs, settings, extensions, you name it.  One thing I was amazed by is how fast it was.  While setting it up, I deleted an extension for Flutter that I no longer use.  It was removed from my other computer in less than a minute.

This isn't a tutorial, but this is a really cool feature that I wish I knew about before.  One thing that I wish it had is syncing extension configurations.  That would be *so useful* with extensions like [Wakatime][wakatime], being extensions that require an API key to use, but easy to forget about configuring.  It's one of the extensions that you don't really think about, but you expect to be there.  (My Wakatime stats can be found [here](/about/stats).)

That's all for today.

Cheers,

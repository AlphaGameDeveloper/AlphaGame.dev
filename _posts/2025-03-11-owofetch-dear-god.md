title: OwOFetch... dear god...
---
So... yes.  This is not a drill.  This is not a joke.  I have started working on a project called OwOFetch.  If any of you have used the UwUFetch program, it's my stupid fork of it.  UwUFetch became a fun joke in my friend group, and upon learning that UwUFetch is no longer being maintained, I impusively made a fork and called it OwOFetch.  It's only fitting, right?

I don't know if this will become a big project, or if I will eventually get bored and forget about it, but so far I'm going full speed ahead on the project.  It's also a good learning opportunity, as all projects should be!

I've wanted to try putting this on some package managers.  The AUR is my first target... I just need to learn how to get packages on there.  It can't be that bad, right?

I am going to be working on this along with another friend of mine, who goes by [@ASexyLordRevan](https://github.com/ASexyLordRevan) on GitHub.  Unlike me, he actually knows how to make ASCII art.  He also does Arch/EndeavourOS rices much better than me.  Very cool guy!

For now, it's Linux only... If you can compile it for anything else, feel free.  A tarball can be found on the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/AlphaGameDeveloper/OwOFetch/releases).  Just download it, extract it, and `sudo ./install.sh`, and `owofetch` away!

Cheers,
- Damien

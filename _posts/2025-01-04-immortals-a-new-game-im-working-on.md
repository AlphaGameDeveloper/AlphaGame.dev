title: Immortals, a new video game I'm working on!
---

For as long as I remember, my username has been AlphaGameDeveloper.  I still find it funny how I have not really been into gamedev much.  It's mainly backend server stuff, networking, and other stuff.

With a few friends of mine, [@CombineSoldier14][combinesoldier14-site], and [@AmanOMG8](https://github.com/AmanOMG8) *(A former Roblox developer, and he knows quite a bit about Unity)*, and a few others, we are working on a roguelike game called *Immortals*.  Lots of stuff is still being planned out, but here is some information.

* The game engine will be **Unity**.
* The game will be availiable for Windows, and Linux.
    * MacOS if we can pull it off.
* It'll be in a medieval sort of theme (swords, shields and all that)

As for a release date, I can't give a good date yet, and I suck with deadlines.  I might be writing more blog posts as progress continues.  We will also potentially make some devlogs on YouTube or something!

Well, that's all for now.  I cannot wait to keep working on it, and hopefully produce something amazing.

Cheers,  
AlphaGameDeveloper

*P.S. A bit late, but happy new year 2025! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰*

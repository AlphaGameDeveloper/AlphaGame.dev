title: What's the Dark Web?
---
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ah, the Dark Web.  Where only the worst of internet content resides.  Content so horrible that it was banished from the open internet, and resides under unreadable union addresses.  I'm here to tell you that that is not the (whole) case.</p>

<p>I can hear at least SOMEONE saying that, and here is an answer: Some of the dark web is bad, with things that I would not like to talk about here, and people who use it's anonymous nature for less-than-legal things, such as murder;  And 57% of the dark web is for illegal activity (<a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/taking-dark-web-law-enforcement-experts-id-investigative-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="ojp.gov">ojp.gov</a>), but it was actually created with good intentions.  The dark web is also used today to bypass government censorship, tracking, and more.  The Dark Web uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Tor">Tor</a> network and lots of onion relays to send your traffic through community-run onion routers.  This makes it so that the website does not know who you are, and you don't know who the website isâ€”no more than that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does it work?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, I can ping Google, and get their server IP address, and if I google "What is my IP address?", I can see that Google knows my IP address.  This goes for any website you go to, whenever you make a request, your client gives the server your public IP address in order to send back the data.  The only difference with the dark web is that it sends your data securely, with a random circuit of 3 Tor nodes.  None of them know who you are, or where you are trying to go.  You can even run a Tor node yourself, and help out.*</p>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you want to run a Tor node, be sure to run an ENTRY or MIDDLE node.  Exit nodes are dangerous and difficult to run, and tend to be run by only well-known originations because these tend to access illegal content, you would want to let your ISP and/or local law enforcement know that you are running an exit node.  See the FAQs for Relay Operators by Tor.</p>

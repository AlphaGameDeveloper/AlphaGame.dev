## High Dominance
**I got a score of *89* for dominance.**  Being high D means that, when I go into a team, I want to be the leader of the team.
<blockquote>High D's tend to
be competitive,
decisive, and
determined.</blockquote> 

## High Influencing
**I got a score of *84* for influencing.**  This means that I enjoy working with people.  When I do a project, I get it done via people.

## Low Steadiness

**I got a score of *18* for steadiness.** This means that I like change.  I like it when I wake up, and everything is different from the day before.  I am not a routines person, and I prefer to go with the flow.

## Low Compliance

**I got a score of *14* for compliance.**  This means that I will try to do my plan, rather than someone else's.  Othen in a group project, I am the one giving the orders mostly, rather than getting ordered.

## Skills
Here are some of my Indigo skills

### Presenting

When I present, I have a tendancy to make the people excited *and/or* entertained, and also advertise on top of that.  I enjoy public speaking, especially if it a topic that I am passionate about. **(High D and High I)**

### Persuasion

I love working with people, and persuasion is important in that I have to move people into my way of thinking so that we can do the best job possible.  **(High I *with High D*)**

### Management

This comes along with high D.  I enjoy managing what other people do in a project so that everyone can do what they are good at. **(High D)**

## High Dominance
**I got a score of *89* for dominance.**  Being high D means that, when I go into a team, I want to be the leader of the team.
<blockquote>High D's tend to
be competitive,
decisive, and
determined.</blockquote> 

## High Influencing
**I got a score of *84* for influencing.**  This means that I enjoy working with people.  When I do a project, I get it done via people.

## Low Steadiness

**I got a score of *18* for steadiness.** This means that I like change.  I like it when I wake up, and everything is different from the day before.  I am not a routines person, and I prefer to go with the flow.

## Low Compliance

**I got a score of 14 for compliance.**  This means that I will try to do my plan, rather than someone else's.  Othen in a group project, I am the one giving the orders mostly, rather than getting ordered.

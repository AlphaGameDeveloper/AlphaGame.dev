# 3D-Printing Homeless Houses

And with that, the first project done of 2024 is done!  In this project, we decided on
a world problem, being homelessness, hunger, *political unrest?*, and found a solution on
what we were going to do, and present it!  We chose homelessness, because...well... Look
at San Francisco right now!  We used our **Damien&Flint(tm) Thinking Caps Version 2** 
<sup>(patent pending)</sup> and decided to use concrete 3d printing to make them!  This idea was heavily
inspired by [JerryRigEverything](https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything)'s video
[*"I 3D Printed Printed a 6,000 Pound Statue of Myself"*](https://youtu.be/FaNLkd0rzXk)
where he used a huge 3d printer in order to send his friend, ["What's Inside?"](https://www.youtube.com/user/lincolnmarkham)
a 6,000 pound statue of himself, because that's what you do, right?

## When we started
When we started this project, we decided to make a prototype made of wood.  We did this at a 1:4 scale *(i.e, 1 foot in the prototype equals 4 feet in the real world)*.  This made our job one million times easier as we only had to build 1' by 1'4" for the prototype.)

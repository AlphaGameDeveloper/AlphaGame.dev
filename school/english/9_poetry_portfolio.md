# Poetry Portfolio
**NOTE**:  This was meant to be a Google Slides.  Ordinary people would *do* a google slides.  Unfortunately, *I AM NOT ORDINARY PEOPLE*, and I needed content, so I put it on this site!

## Poem #1
```plaintext
A distraction on my desk,
Noise seeming to block out the rest.
It seems impossible to focus on a test,
with such a device on my desk.
With apps competing for my attention,
All trying to make an impression,
it just feels like a depression.
A day that I don't give my attention as expected,
Watching meaningless numbers ever climb
Friends of mine climb to my door,
Wondering why I didn't
Give into the push notifications in my pocket.
```

## Loud in Here
<!-- LoudInHere -->
```text
It’s loud in here:
The thoughts never stop knocking on my door
It’s crazy in here, a never-ending brainstorm
Just can’t hear through the chaos and the noise

Looping in C++ or a explosive pencil sharpener,
Questions unbidden, taking up space.
I long to silence this cognitive flood,
If only I could, oh, I surely would.

Random questions, with no purpose
Stuff like the proper rhyme and reason of
Not looping malloc() in C++, or potentially
How to sharpen a pencil explosively with a whoosh and a boom
```

## Introduction
Well, folks, we have now completed yet another project!  What project, you ask?  *(well you could have just looked at the title, but oh well)* the **Outdoor Furniture Design** project!  
In this unit, we designed bits of furniture to place around the [San Marin Campus][map].  This project involved loads of planning, Computer-Aided Design ([CAD][wikipedia-cad]), and so much more, so hold onto your butts!

## Getting Started
Getting Started, we were wondering what to make.  We knew from the start that we wanted to make something unique.  Something that people would look and be like, *"Damn, that looks pretty cool!"*.  Luckily, Mr. Williams brought us outside, and we noticed a chair with a aluminum roof (to shield from sun), and we took insperation from that... At that moment, we thought *"That's what were gonna do!"*.  We planned and decided on a bench with a aluminum roof, **but** with some tables.  I KNOW, GIVE US A BIG HAND, SO ORIGINAL.

## Information

We made the first prototype in [CAD][wikipedia-cad], but it was not the 3D modeling that I was used to--I use [Sketchup][sketchup], normally.  However, I was not able to use it because of the fact that we had to have each individual wooden beam in our 3D model.  If I were to use sketchup, that would have taken me the longer part of forever *(If it were possible in the first place)*, so I had to learn and use a [CAD][wikipedia-cad] software called [Tinkercad][tinkercad].  Tinkercad was, well, difficult to learn, as it was so very different from [Sketchup][sketchup].  One thing that really threw me off was that everything in Tinkercad is it's own shape.  These shapes can be grouped, but everything must be it's own independant object, unlike [Sketchup][sketchup].  Anyway, rant over.

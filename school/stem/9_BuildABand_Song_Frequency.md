# Frequency

## About
Frequency is a song that I wrote.  It is meant to be sung to the song ["Intro"](https://youtu.be/qFq6nnw7xg0) by the xx.  I chose Intro because it is instrumental, so we can easily add lyrics in it. Also it's a great song!  

## Lyrics
<pre>
<b>[WAIT 10 BEATS BEFORE STARTING!]</b>

<b>[VERSE 1]</b>

In the silence, where waves collide,
Particles dance, in rhythmic stride.
[WAIT] 
From the cosmos, to the smallest atom,
Resonance whispers, in every datum.

<b>[CHORUS]</b>
Frequency, in oscillation's play,
Vibrations echo, in the light of day.
[WAIT FOR HIGH BEAT]
From infrared whispers, to ultraviolet hue,
Physics sings, in wavelengths true.

<b>[VERSE 2]</b>
In harmonic motion, symphonies unfold,
Einstein's theories, in stories untold.
From Newton's apple, to quantum's leap,
Physics' melody, in secrets keep.

<b>[Bridge]</b>
Wavelengths stretch, in electromagnetic wave,
Sound waves dance, in the sonic enclave.
[WAIT FOR </>]
From gamma's fury, to radio's call,
Physics' embrace, envelopes all.

<b>[CHORUS]</b>
Frequency, in oscillation's play,
Vibrations echo, in the light of day.
[DO NOT WAIT FOR HIGH NOTE]
From infrared whispers, to ultraviolet hue,
Physics sings, in wavelengths true

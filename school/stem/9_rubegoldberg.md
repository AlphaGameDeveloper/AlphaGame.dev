# Rube Goldberg Machines
We created Rube Goldberg machines as a start-of-the-year collaboration assignment. This was our first taste of collaborative work in the STEM Marin program, and I would like to say that it was AMAZING at working in a group–but let’s just say that there is A LOT of room for improvement as far as teamwork. We did get a good grade on this assignment, below are our graded rubrics. (on a 1 through 4 grading system)

## After that...

After that, we got our grades and reflected on how we did this project.  You can see the presentation slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16YJb9Ys83ohV5ukrnTJJi-tT3yhpGK_qf0iz_G76FFU/edit?usp=sharing).

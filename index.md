# About Me

My name is Damien Boisvert, and I am 14 years old.  I have been running this website since 2021, shortly after the COVID-19 craziness ended.  I am a freshman, and have a passion for computers, programming, and almost everything IT.  I am completely self-taught, via YouTube, books that my dad has, and HackTheBox.  I am currently working on my Cisco CCNA at school, and I am a recommended-black belt in Taekwondo.

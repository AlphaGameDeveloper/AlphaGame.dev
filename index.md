# AlphaGameDeveloper

## Hi, I'm Damien.
My name is Damien Boisvert, but I am more commonly known on the Internet as AlphaGameDeveloper, or AlphaGameDev.  I am 15 years old, and have a passion for computers, programming, and networking.  I am a contributor to open-source software on my [GitHub][github].  If you want it, here's my [GPG key](/gpg)!

I am in 10<sup>th</sup> grade, and am currently working on getting my Cisco certifications.  I also write on my [blog](/blog) in my spare time, and also work on my Discord bot, [AlphaGameBot](/alphagamebot/). ([Learn more!](/about/))

By night, I am a hardcore MBTI nerd, writing algorithms and research the *Myers-Briggs Type Indicator* personality system.  I am an [ENTP][entp-personality] personality (also known as *"The Debater"*) and a [7w8][7w8-annegram] on annegram.  My alignment is [Chaotic Neutral][chaotic-neutral].  My MBTI stuff can be found [here](/mbti/)!

## Hey, there!
My name is Damien Boisvert, but I am more commonly known on the Internet as AlphaGameDeveloper, or AlphaGameDev.  I find that funny, as my main focus has shifted away from game development a bit. :)  Nevertheless, here I am.  I exist.  I am 14 years old, and I have a passion for computers, programming, you name it.
## Accomplishments

- Memorized one hundred digits of the mathematical constant pi (Ï€)
    - Made sixty of which out of wine corks, and hung it on my wall (took about 3 full walls!)
- Memorized 80 elements of the Periodic Table of the Elements
- Professional nerd :)
- Listened to *Mr. Blue Sky* for 4 hours straight
